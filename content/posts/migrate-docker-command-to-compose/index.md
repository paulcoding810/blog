## Migrating Docker Commands to Docker Compose

Transitioning from Docker commands to Docker Compose can streamline your workflow, especially when managing multiple containers. Docker Compose enables you to define and run multi-container applications using a straightforward YAML configuration file. This guide outlines the steps to convert common Docker commands into Docker Compose equivalents for easier application management.

## Steps to Migrate

### 1. Generate a Docker Compose File

Leverage the [docker-autocompose](https://github.com/Red5d/docker-autocompose) tool to create a `docker-compose.yml` file from your existing Docker setup. This tool inspects your running containers and generates a Compose file automatically.

### 2. Clean Up Old Containers

Identify and remove old containers to avoid conflicts:

```bash
docker container ls -a | grep container_name
docker container stop container_id
docker container rm container_id
```

### 3. Start with Docker Compose

Run your application using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 4. Adjust Data Directories (if needed)

If your application uses a data directory, ensure it is correctly relocated and permissions are updated:

```bash
sudo rsync -aP data_dir/ new_compose_dir/data_dir/
# Update ownership if necessary
sudo chown user:group -R new_compose_dir/data_dir/
```

Update the `docker-compose.yml` file to reflect the new data directory path.

By following these steps, you can seamlessly migrate to Docker Compose, making your container management more efficient and maintainable.
